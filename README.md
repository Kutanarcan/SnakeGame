# Snake Game With Unity 

I started this project with 2 goals in mind: Writing a Unit Test and Making a game with CoPilot comment prompts.

- Grid Base Generated Cells
- Cells using [Struct Of Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA) Method
- Snake Head Movement and Body Shifting
- C# Based Architecture
- Initialize-DeInitialize and Relaunch The Game At will
- Draw Call Optimized
- Event Based Communication
- Monobehaviour Used as Frontend
